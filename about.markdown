I'm Kush Goyal and welcome to my blog. I write on my blog to share what I learned.
Topics I like are SaaS, coding, books, music, fitness and how to learn new things.

I grew up in New Delhi, India. I am the co founder at [sumtracker.com](https://sumtracker.com) where I
wear many hats including sales, marketing and backend development. I write code in python and use django 
framework for creating APIs. I am a huge classic rock fan, mostly from the 80s.
