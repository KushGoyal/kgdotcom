I'm Kush Goyal and welcome to my blog. I write on my blog to share what I learned.
Topics I like are SaaS, books, music, fitness and how to learn new things.

I grew up in New Delhi, India. I am the co founder at [sumtracker.com](https://sumtracker.com) where I
wear many hats including marketing and backend development. I program in Python and Java.
My interest is in building amazing software for SMEs.
